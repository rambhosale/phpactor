Package Structure
-----------------

Phpactor is divided into _packages_. Each package occupies a directory in
`lib/`. In addition there are extensions which integrate packages with
Phpactor which are in `lib/Extension`.

Tests and benchmarks are maintained in the package's directory, e.g.
`lib/WorseReflection/Tests`.
